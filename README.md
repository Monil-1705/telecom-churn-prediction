# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** in the telecom industry using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service provider, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## ⚙️ Key Steps
- Performed **EDA** with scatterplots, pairplots, and skewness checks.  
- Applied **log transformation** and **scaling** to handle feature skewness.  
- Used **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance in the dataset.  
- Built and compared multiple classification models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Voting Classifier (Ensemble)  
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix**.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `main.ipynb` → Full notebook with EDA, preprocessing, model training & evaluation.  
- `telecom_churn.csv` → Dataset (or sample dataset if full data cannot be shared).  
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).  

## 🚀 Results & Insights
- Models trained with **SMOTE and feature scaling** showed improved performance.  
- **Ensemble methods (Voting Classifier, Random Forest)** outperformed individual models.  
- Key factors influencing churn were identified, providing actionable business insights.
